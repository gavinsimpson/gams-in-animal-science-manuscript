  abstract = {Summary. Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical
  basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to
  generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in
  semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML)
  based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use
  iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear
  approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to
  do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very
  reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are
  available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the
  GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of
  the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties.
  The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of
  smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate
  REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization.
  This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton–Raphson iteration, rather than
  Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach
  to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton
  method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit
  differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank
  deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in
  numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error
  criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new
  REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance
  relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the
  small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information
  criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost
  as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the
  convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized
  GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example
  applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function
  regression and generalized additive model selection.},

  abstract = {Using sensors, the health and welfare of growing-finishing pigs
  can be continuously monitored by detecting deviations from pigs' normal
  behaviour, but the validity of such algorithms requires improvement. As
  changes in the environment influence pig behaviour, monitoring temporal
  changes in environmental factors may help identify periods with a higher risk
  of welfare issues. The real-time relationships between pig welfare and many
  environmental factors are, however, not well-understood. This study examined
  the short-term associations of ambient ammonia with indicators of pig
  production and health. Ambient ammonia concentrations were monitored with
  sensors during the growing-finishing period of three rounds at a German (farm
  G, n = 110 pigs/round) and one round at a Danish farm (farm D, n = 144 pigs).
  Body weight was estimated daily using 3D cameras (both farms), feed intake was
  recorded using electronic feeding stations (only farm G), and health
  indicators were recorded during twice- (farm G) or thrice-weekly (farm D) farm
  visits. Using splines (generalised additive models), ammonia concentrations
  were linked to indicators of pig production and health in real time and, for
  body weight, at a lag of 1, 2, 3 and 7 d. We found a range of relationships
  between ambient ammonia (5 - 50 ppm) and production or health indicators (i.e.
  body weight (real-time and lagged), feed intake, coughing, sneezing, pen
  fouling, diarrhoea, and tear staining), but they were highly inconsistent
  between farms and pig rounds. Part of this inconsistency may be due to
  differences in manure management and sensor locations, or could be explained
  by age or seasonal effects (e.g. heat stress). More robust relationships were
  identified for clinical measures related to pig behaviour, where tail damage
  and skin lesions linearly increased with ammonia from low concentrations (5 -
  10 ppm) onwards, hence suggesting more tail biting and aggression at higher
  ammonia concentrations. In conclusion, ambient ammonia did not clearly
  associate with pig performance and health in the short term, while higher
  ammonia concentrations were related to higher occurrences of clinical signs
  reflecting undesirable behaviours. Therefore, daily ammonia measurements using
  sensors may be of limited value in identifying health issues in pigs, but they
  may aid in detecting periods with high risk of aggressive or tail biting
  behaviours that require interventions. As ambient ammonia was confounded with
  other environmental measurements, such as ambient temperature or carbon
  dioxide concentrations, identified associations should be interpreted
  cautiously or with ammonia as general indicator of air quality.},

  as well as their potential organisational effects on reproduction, moult and
  oxidative stress in adulthood. We found that eggs injected with T4 had a
  higher hatching success compared with control eggs, suggesting conversion of
  T4 into T3 by the embryo. We detected no evidence for other short-term or
  long-term effects of yolk THs. These results suggest that yolk THs are
  important in the embryonic stage of precocial birds, but other short- and
  long-term consequences remain unclear. Research on maternal THs will greatly

  abstract = {Abstract Generalized additive models (GAMs) are a frequently used,
  flexible framework applied to many problems in statistical ecology. They are
  commonly used to incorporate smooth effects into models via splines, including
  spatial components in species distribution models. GAMs are often considered
  to be a purely frequentist framework (‘generalized linear models with wiggly
  bits’), however links between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to these
  models were highlighted early‐on in the literature. From a practical
  perspective, Bayesian thinking underlies many parts of the implementation in
  the popular R package mgcv, so understanding these underpinnings can be
  informative during model building and assessment. This article aims to
  highlight useful links (and differences) between Bayesian and frequentist
  approaches to smoothing, as detailed in the statistical literature, in
  accessible way, with a focus on the mgcv implementation. By harnessing these
  links we can expand the set of modelling tools we have at our disposal, as
  well as our understanding of how existing methods work. Two important topics
  for quantitative ecologists are covered in detail: model term selection and
  uncertainty estimation. Taking Bayesian viewpoints for these problems makes
  them much more tractable in many applied settings. Examples are given using

  methods for fitting penalized regression spline based generalized additive

  $$10\textasciicircum8$$108data. The methods offered two to three orders of
  magnitude reduction in computational cost relative to the most efficient
  previous methods. Part of the gain resulted from the development of a set of
  methods for efficiently computing model matrix products when model covariates
  each take only a discrete set of values substantially smaller than the sample
  size [generalizing an idea first appearing in Lang et al. (Stat Comput
  24(2):223–238, 2014)]. Covariates can always be rounded to achieve such
  discretization, and it should be noted that the covariate discretization is
  marginal. That is we do not rely on discretizing covariates jointly, which
  would typically require the use of very coarse discretization. The most
  expensive computation in model estimation is the formation of the matrix cross
  product $$\mathbf{X}\textasciicircum{\mathsf{T}}{\mathbf{WX}}$$XTWXwhere
  $$\mathbf{X}$$Xis a model matrix and $${\mathbf{W}}$$Wa diagonal or

  abstract = {ABSTRACTThis article discusses a general framework for smoothing
  parameter estimation for models with regular likelihoods constructed in terms
  of unknown smooth functions of covariates. Gaussian random effects and
  parametric terms may also be present. By construction the method is
  numerically stable and convergent, and enables smoothing parameter uncertainty
  to be quantified. The latter enables us to fix a well known problem with AIC
  for such models, thereby improving the range of model selection tools
  available. The smooth functions are represented by reduced rank spline like
  smoothers, with associated quadratic penalties measuring function smoothness.
  Model estimation is by penalized likelihood maximization, where the smoothing
  parameters controlling the extent of penalization are estimated by Laplace
  approximate marginal likelihood. The methods cover, for example, generalized
  additive models for nonexponential family responses (e.g., beta, ordered
  categorical, scaled t distribution, negative binomial and Tweedie
  distributions), generalized additive models for location scale and shape
  (e.g., two stage zero inflation models, and Gaussian location-scale models),
  Cox proportional hazards models and multivariate additive models. The
  framework reduces the implementation of new model classes to the coding of
  some standard derivatives of the log-likelihood. Supplementary materials for

  for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). The model assumes independent
  observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory
  variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the
  response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of
  distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete
  distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling
  not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the
  distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth)
  functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum
  (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A
  Newton–Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized)
  likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting
  algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data
  sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the
  generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

  abstract = {Estimating daily enteric hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) emitted
  from dairy cattle using spot sampling techniques requires accurate sampling
  schemes. These sampling schemes determine the number of daily samplings and
  their intervals. This simulation study assessed the accuracy of daily H2 and
  CH4 emissions from dairy cattle using various sampling schemes for gas
  collection. Gas emission data were available from a crossover experiment with
  28 cows fed twice daily at 80\% to 95\% of the ad libitum intake, and an
  experiment that used a repeated randomized block design with 16 cows twice
  daily fed ad libitum. Gases were sampled every 12 to 15 min for 3 consecutive
  days in climate respiration chambers. Feed was fed in 2 equal portions per day
  in both experiments. Per individual cow-period combination, generalized
  additive models were fitted to all diurnal H2 and CH4 emission profiles. Per
  profile, the models were fitted using the generalized cross-validation, REML,
  REML while assuming correlated residuals, and REML while assuming
  heteroscedastic residuals. The areas under the curve (AUC) of these 4 fits
  were numerically integrated over 24 h to compute the daily production and
  compared with the mean of all data points, which was considered the reference.
  Next, the best of the 4 fits was used to evaluate 9 different sampling
  schemes. This evaluation determined the average predicted values sampled at
  0.5, 1, and 2 h intervals starting at 0 h from morning feeding, at 1 and 2 h
  intervals starting at 0.5 h from morning feeding, at 6 and 8 h intervals
  starting at 2 h from morning feeding, and at 2 unequally spaced intervals with
  2 or 3 samples per day. Sampling every 0.5 h was needed to obtain daily H2
  productions not different from the selected AUC for the restricted feeding
  experiment, whereas less frequent sampling had predictions varying from 47\%
  to 233\% of the AUC. For the ad libitum feeding experiment, sampling schemes
  had H2 productions from 85\% to 155\% of the corresponding AUC. For the
  restricted feeding experiment, daily CH4 production needed samplings every 2 h
  or shorter, or 1 h or shorter, depending on sampling time after feeding,
  whereas sampling scheme did not affect CH4 production for the twice daily ad
  libitum feeding experiment. In conclusion, sampling scheme had a major impact
  on predicted daily H2 production, particularly with restricted feeding,
  whereas daily CH4 production was less severely affected by sampling scheme.},

  dimensional data, which can be fitted by regression or penalized regression

  truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline
  smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed
  to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline
  smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the
  smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation
  are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin
  plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are
  associated with ‘knot placement’ that usually complicate modelling with
  regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of
  modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank
  approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use
  with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of
  more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational
  efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines.
  Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it
  also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in
  linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any
  other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and

  abstract = {Heat stress is one of the most critical issues jeopardising animal
  welfare and productivity during the warm season in dairy cattle farms. The
  global trend of increase in average and peak temperatures is making the
  problem more and more serious. Many devices have been introduced in livestock
  farms to monitor and control temperature-humidity index, as well as animal
  behaviour and production parameters. The consequent availability of collected
  databases has increasingly enhanced the research aimed to understand the
  consequences of heat stress in cattle, in relation to genetic, reproductive,
  productive and behavioural features. Moreover, these investigations laid the
  foundations for the development, calibration, validation and test of numerical
  models quantifying the individual responses to heat stress conditions. In this
  work, a generalised additive model with mixed effects has been developed to
  analyse the relationship between milk production, animal behaviour and
  environmental parameters based on data surveyed in 2016 in an Italian dairy
  farm. Each cow has been characterised in terms of her response to heat
  conditions, and the results led to define three classes of susceptibility to
  heat stress within the herd. These attributes have then been related to the
  various phenotypic parameters collected by the precision livestock farming
  devices used in the farm. The study provides a model to understand the effects
  of heat stress conditions on individual animals in relation to the main
  parameters describing their rearing conditions; moreover, the results
  contribute to improve the herd management by lending indications to define
  targeted treatments according to the cow's characteristics.},

  how mastitis affected milk production. Using generalized additive models, we
  analyzed 50,618 test-day records from 8,081 lactations from 7,912 cows in 197
  herds between January 2021 and March 2022 to estimate the nonlinear
  interaction between SCS and DSCC, and the effects of lactation stages and
  seasons on milk yield, milk component percentages, and milk component yields
  by parity of cows. The results show that the interaction between SCS and DSCC
  on these traits was significant, nonlinear, and complex. When DSCC was high,
  the negative effects of SCS were minimal, even when SCS reached 8 (i.e.,
  3,200,000 somatic cells/mL). Cows with high DSCC could have milk yields
  similar to healthy cows, implying that these cows may have been in the early
  stages of mastitis and that the milk yield had yet to be affected.
  Contrastingly, when DSCC was low, milk loss due to high SCS was drastic,
  especially for cows in third or later lactations, whose milk yield could
  reduce from more than 35 kg/d to less than 15 kg/d (-59.9\%). This tremendous
  milk loss in high-parity cows was likely due to their higher milk yield and
  higher risks of chronic mastitis. High SCS and low DSCC also led to a
  pronounced change in milk composition. The decrease in the percentage of
  lactose can be directly related to the damage of inflammation to the mammary
  gland, while the increase in fat and protein percentages was more attributable
  to the concentration effect resulting from the reduced milk yield. Compared
  with analyses based on categorized SCS and DSCC values, modeling these 2
  indices directly helps us more precisely assess mastitis impacts on milk yield
  and milk composition. For efficient milk production, our results indicate that
  we should prevent high-parity cows from entering a state of high SCS and low
  DSCC.},

  Goats program (HG), with the aim of eradicating caprine arthritis
  encephalitis, caseous lymphadenitis, and Johne's disease (caprine
  paratuberculosis) in Norwegian goat herds. The aim of the present study was to
  explore how control and eradication of the above-mentioned diseases by
  enrolling in HG affected milk yield by comparison with herds not enrolled in
  HG. Lactation curves were modeled using a multilevel cubic spline regression
  model where farm, goat, and lactation were included as random effect
  parameters. The data material contained 135,446 registrations of daily milk
  yield from 28,829 lactations in 43 herds. The multilevel cubic spline
  regression model was applied to 4 categories of data: enrolled early, control
  early, enrolled late, and control late. For enrolled herds, the early and late
  notations refer to the situation before and after enrolling in HG; for
  nonenrolled herds (controls), they refer to development over time, independent
  of HG. Total milk yield increased in the enrolled herds after eradication: the
  total milk yields in the fourth lactation were 634.2 and 873.3 kg in enrolled
  early and enrolled late herds, respectively, and 613.2 and 701.4 kg in the
  control early and control late herds, respectively. Day of peak yield differed
  between enrolled and control herds. The day of peak yield came on d 6 of
  lactation for the control early category for parities 2, 3, and 4, indicating
  an inability of the goats to further increase their milk yield from the
  initial level. For enrolled herds, on the other hand, peak yield came between
  d 49 and 56, indicating a gradual increase in milk yield after kidding. Our
  results indicate that enrollment in the HG disease eradication program
  improved the milk yield of dairy goats considerably, and that the multilevel
  cubic spline regression was a suitable model for exploring effects of disease
  control and eradication on milk yield.},

  lactation curves in dairy cattle. Over the last ninety years, the development
  of this field of study has followed the main requirements of the dairy cattle
  industry. Non-linear parametric functions have represented the preferred tools
  for modelling average curves of homogeneous groups of animals, with the main
  aim of predicting yields for management purposes. The increased availability
  of records per individual lactations and the genetic evaluation based on test
  day records has shifted the interest of modellers towards more flexible and
  general linear functions, as polynomials or splines. Thus the main interest of
  modelling is no longer the reconstruction of the general pattern of the
  phenomenon but the fitting of individual deviations from an average curve.
  Other specific approaches based on the modelling of the correlation structure
  of test day records within lactation, such as mixed linear models or principal
  component analysis, have been used to test the statistical significance of
  fixed effects in dairy experiments or to create new variables expressing main
  lactation curve traits. The adequacy of a model is not an absolute requisite,
  because it has to be assessed according to the specific purpose it is used
  for. Occurrence of extended lactations and of new productive and functional
  traits to be described and the increase of records coming from automatic
  milking systems likely will represent some of the future challenges for the
  mathematical modelling of the lactation curve in dairy cattle.},

  cell proliferation and cell death, was studied and compared to the equation of
  Wood (1967). Lactation curves of British Holstein Friesian cows (176 curves),
  Spanish Churra sheep (40 curves) and Spanish Murciano–Granadina goats (30
  curves) were used for model evaluation. Both models were fitted in their
  original form using non-linear least squares estimation. The parameters were
  compared among species and among parity groups within species.In general, both
  models provided highly significant fits to lactation data and described the
  data accurately. The mechanistic model performed well against Wood's 1967
  equation (hereafter referred to as Wood's equation), resulting in smaller
  residual mean square values in more than two-thirds of the datasets
  investigated, and producing parameter estimates that allowed appropriate
  comparisons and noticeable trends attributed to shape. Using Akaike or
  Bayesian information criteria, goodness-of-fit with the mechanistic model was
  superior to that with Wood's equation for the cow lactation curves, with no
  significant differences between models when fitted to goat or sheep lactation
  curves. The rate parameters of the mechanistic model, representing specific
  proliferation rate of mammary secretory cells at parturition, decay associated
  with reduction in cell proliferation capacity with time and specific death
  rate of mammary secretory cells, were smaller for primiparous than for
  multiparous cows. Greater lactation persistency of cows compared to goats and
  sheep, and decrease in persistency with parity, were shown to be represented
  by different values of the specific secretory cell death rate parameter in the
  mechanistic model. The plausible biological interpretation and fitting
  properties of the mechanistic model enable it to be used in complex models of
  whole-cow digestion and metabolism and as a tool in selection programmes and
  by dairy producers for management decisions.},
